# Noor ðŸ’¡

## Introduction

Noorâ€™s system intelligently reads ambient light levels using an LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor) connected to an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converterâ€”BCF8591).
Upon processing the received data, the Raspberry Pi then adjusts the brightness of an LED light via precise PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) control, ensuring optimal lighting conditions are maintained.
